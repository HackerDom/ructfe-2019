# Patrol

Constant Vigilance! Submarines must keep track of everything that happens in the world.
HQ is ready to entrust you with military secrets, but only if you can mark cities on a map for placing submarines so that each city is under the supervision of at least one submarine. I.e. for each city there must either be a submarine in it or in some directly connected city. At the same time, placing a submarine in a city costs money, and you should not spend more than HQ's budget.

However, the command does not want your deployment plans to be intercepted, so it does not ask you for a plan, but only for evidence that such a plan exists.
