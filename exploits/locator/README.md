## Locator service

#### Functional
* Registration with required and custom fields;
* Listing users;
* Awesome graphics radar in CSS and JS;
* Watching logged user's register info.

#### Under the hood
When user clicks the registration button, browser [generates](https://github.com/HackerDom/ructfe-2019/blob/f3e1d757b2f11ee7cc5e8e6d7d6cc1f021546b71/services/locator/src/main/resources/static/js/main.js#L53) the info with custom fields. While generating info, all custom fields are ~~encoding~~ [turning into the java class](https://github.com/HackerDom/ructfe-2019/blob/master/services/locator/src/main/resources/static/js/pure-encoder.js) and. It's minimalistic java class contains all custom fields (also, **speed**, **color** and **size**) as java object fields; also this class has the default constructor without parameters. After successful registration user can view his info. At this moment, server ~~decodes~~ [creates java object](https://github.com/HackerDom/ructfe-2019/blob/master/services/locator/src/main/kotlin/Decoder.kt#L8) via calling default constructor and [initiating](https://github.com/HackerDom/ructfe-2019/blob/master/services/locator/src/main/kotlin/Decoder.kt#L13-L20) fields with data string (message).

#### Attack (RCE)
Obvious way is just [generate](https://github.com/HackerDom/ructfe-2019/blob/master/services/locator/src/main/java/Exploit.kt) a java class with needed code in constructor, then send a register request with this class and request the `/info` for calling constructor.

#### Defence
Actually, client-side generated java class keeps only list of fields. So, we can remove `clazz.newInstance` [there](https://github.com/HackerDom/ructfe-2019/blob/master/services/locator/src/main/kotlin/Decoder.kt#L10) and build just simple dictionary [there](https://github.com/HackerDom/ructfe-2019/blob/master/services/locator/src/main/kotlin/Decoder.kt#L13-L20) instead of object initiating. Finally, we pass usual json.
