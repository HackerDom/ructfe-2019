[This](/services/profile/dockers/lwe/service/rlwe.py) algo looks like RLWE, but works with vectors, not polynomials. In this case you can use modified [CVP exploit](/home/mikhalych/Desktop/ructfe-2019/services/profile/dockers/lwe/service/rlwe.py) to [recover](./lwe_exploit.sage) secret key from public key.

To close this vulnerability you need to increase the size of vectors field multiple times.
