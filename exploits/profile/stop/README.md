[Nitzerwint](/services/profile/dockers/stop/service/stop.py) algo implements Winternitz PQ OTS algorithm. (here `Lampfie` is a reference to Lamport-Diffie algo).

The main vulnerability here was in the same pair of public and private keys for one user but different notes. You can brute `md5(random_bytes).digest()`, where `i`'th block is the same as in hash, that we need to sign. Signature's part related to this part of hash would be the same as in real signature.

You can check it [here](./stop_exploit.py)

To close it you can generate different keys for different notes. Checker sends hash of your note to `get_pub_key` to realize it.

There was also an unintended vulnerability in `verify` function. You can use empty signature to skip `zip` iterating. Then your signature would be always True without any check.
